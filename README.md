Scripts for editing metadata for the Arctic Data Center at NCEAS

A sample set of scripts used to create, edit, and update metadata for data packages published onto the Arctic Data Center catalog: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/ 
The NSF Arctic Data Center helps the research community reproducibly preserve and discover all products of NSF-funded science in the Arctic, including data, metadata, software, documents, and provenance that link these in a coherent knowledge model. Key to the initiative is the partnership between the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at UC Santa Barbara, DataONE, and NOAAâ€™s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), each of which bring critical capabilities to the Center. Infrastructure from the successful NSF-sponsored DataONE federation of data repositories enables data replication to NCEI, providing both offsite and institutional diversity that is critical to long term preservation.

Each script included in this repository represents the metadata processing workflow for an individual ticket, or for an individual data package eventually published onto the catalog after peer-review.
